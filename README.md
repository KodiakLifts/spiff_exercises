# Spiff Front-end Candidate Coding Exercises

### Purpose
The following exercises are meant to help Spiff gain insight into how you would tackle actual feature requests by the product team. The exercises are relatively simple, but you are encouraged to treat them as if you were working on the Spiff codebase. This means applying the same attention to code quality, testing, pull requests, commits, etc as you normally would. Quality is valued above quantity.

### Instructions
1. Clone the repo
2. Retreive dependencies `yarn`
3. Mark your start time at the bottom of this README.md
4. Start the dev server: `yarn start`. The app should open on http://localhost:3000
5. Choose one of the exercises on the index page
6. Review the specs provided for the exercise
7. Complete the exercise by providing a `solution` prop to the corresponding component. E.g. The ProgressBar exercise is found in ProgressBar.js.
8. Mark your finish time at the bottom of this README.md

### Guidelines

- Try to limit your total time to 3.5 hours. If you feel like you need more time to adequately demonstrate your ability and thought process, please do. There are likely more steps than you can complete in 3.5 hours.
- Testing: write unit tests where you can and don't worry about component tests.
- Place css and test files beside the component they relate to (same directory)
- Feel free to use any non-human resources you like: StackOverflow, Google, reference code on Github, etc.
- If you run out of time, please add a few quick comments explaining what you would have done if you had more time. The same is true if instructions were unclear or if you have any other thoughts.

Thank you for taking the time to complete this coding assessment! Don't stress too much about any one thing, we evaluate the exercises holistically.
