# Spiff Front-end Candidate Coding Exercises

### Purpose 
The following exercises are meant to give Spiff a glimpse into how you would tackle actual feature requests by the product team. The exercises are relatively simple for time reasons, but you are encouraged to treat them as if you were working on the spiff codebase. This means applying the same attention to code quality, tests, pull requests, commits, etc unless otherwise noted in the exercise.

### Instructions
1. Clone the repo
2. Mark your start time at the bottom of this README.md
3. Start the dev server: `yarn start`. The app should open on http://localhost:3000
3. Choose one of the exercises on the index page
4. Review the specs provided for the exercise
5. Mark your finish time at the bottom of this README.md

### Guidelines
- Spend no more than 3 hours in total. There are likely more steps than you can complete in the alloted time frame. Try to do them in order, but you're allowed to skip steps if you get stuck.
- Feel free to use any non-human resources you like: StackOverflow, Google, reference code on Github, etc.
- If you run out of time, please add a few quick comments explaining what you would have done to finish. The same is true if the instructions were unclear.

Thank you for taking the time to complete this coding assessment. Don't stress too much about any one thing - just do the best you can with the time you're given!
